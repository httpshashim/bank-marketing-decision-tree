# ðŸ§  Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset

This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using a Decision Tree Classifier. The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To build a decision tree classifier that predicts customer subscription (`yes` or `no`) based on demographic and behavioral data.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Rows:** 45,211
- **Columns:** 17+
- **Target Variable:** `y` (subscription)

---

## âœ… Key Tasks Performed

- âœ… Data Cleaning (`unknown` replaced with nulls)
- âœ… Handling missing values (filled with `0`)
- âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - Balance vs Subscription
  - Age Group vs Subscription
- âœ… Built Decision Tree Classifier (using scikit-learn)
- âœ… Visualized top 3 levels of the decision tree
- âœ… Identified top 10 important features
- âœ… Saved prediction results to CSV
